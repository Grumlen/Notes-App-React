#Notes-React App
##Description
Notes-React Application was built using Node, React, Redux, React-Redux, Uuid, Enzyme, and Semantic UI, and allows a user to create, edit, and delete notes.

Each note is a separate entity that is in either a display or editing state. The first note window is always the "Add Note" window, which will generate new notes when the user clicks "Add". In the display state a note may be toggled to the edit state or deleted. In the editing state a note may be modified and saved or canceled, which returns the note to its previous form.
